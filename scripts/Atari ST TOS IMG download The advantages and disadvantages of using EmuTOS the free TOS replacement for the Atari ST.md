The Atari ST is a series of personal computers originally released by Atari Corporation in 1985. It was a popular computer in the 1980s and early 1990s, particularly in Europe, due to its affordability and compatibility with a wide range of software. The ST was based on the Motorola 68000 microprocessor and came equipped with 512 KB of RAM and a floppy disk drive. It also featured a high-resolution monochrome display and a mouse, which made it suitable for desktop publishing and graphic design. One of the key features of the Atari ST was its MIDI support, which made it a popular platform for musicians and music producers. The ST was capable of running a variety of music software, including sequencers, synthesizers, and editors. The Atari ST was also home to a number of popular games, such as Dungeon Master, Lemmings, and Speedball. These games were often praised for their fast and smooth gameplay, as well as their superior graphics and sound compared to other home computers of the time.
 
To run Atari ST software on modern computers, you need an emulator such as Hatari. Hatari is a free and open-source emulator that supports all Atari machines, from the ST to the Falcon. Hatari also needs a TOS image file for running. TOS stands for The Operating System, and it is the firmware that controls the basic functions of the Atari ST. But since TOS is still copyrighted, you cannot download it legally from the internet. However, if you have an original Atari ST, you can make an image file from its TOS ROMs. There are programs like TOSDUMP.PRG or WINX that can create TOS images on a real ST.

Note that depending on the machine type that you want to emulate, you can only use certain TOS versions. The plain ST mode only works with TOS 1.00, 1.02, 1.04, or 2.06. STE mode requires any of the TOS versions 1.xx or 2.xx. TOS 3.0x is for TT, and TOS 4.0x is for Falcon mode.
 
If you don't have any of the original TOS images, you can also try the free EmuTOS TOS replacement supporting all Atari machines. Most programs and games work fine with it (exceptions are unpatched i.e. TOS version dependent STOS games, and Falcon programs using either DSP or TrueColor mode). The official release of Hatari is shipped with the latest EmuTOS image at its release time.
 
To download Hatari and EmuTOS images, you can visit the [Hatari download page](https://hatari.tuxfamily.org/download.html). You can also find some verified Atari ST TOS images at the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/download/verifiedbiosfiles/OGA%20BIOS/Atari%20ST/). To use these images with Hatari, you need to copy them to your Hatari configuration directory (usually ~/.hatari) and rename them according to the machine type you want to emulate (tos100.img for plain ST mode, tos206.img for STE mode, etc.). Then you can launch Hatari and select the appropriate machine type from the options menu.
 
With Hatari and a TOS image file, you can enjoy the nostalgia of using an Atari ST on your modern computer.
