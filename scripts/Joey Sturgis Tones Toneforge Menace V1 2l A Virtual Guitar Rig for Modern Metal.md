**Joey Sturgis Tones** is a company founded by metalcore producer Joey Sturgis, who has worked with dozens of modern metal bands such as Asking Alexandria, Of Mice & Men, The Devil Wears Prada, Miss May I, Emmure, Attila, and many more. He has a unique perspective on what makes a great metal tone, and he has applied his expertise and experience to create **Toneforge Menace V1 2l**, one of the products in the **Toneforge** series of guitar amp simulators.
 
**Toneforge Menace V1 2l** is designed to give you a complete metal tone solution, from the amp head to the cab, mic, effects, and even post-processing. You can customize every aspect of your tone with intuitive controls and presets, or use the built-in impulse responses and IR loader to load your own cab and mic combinations. You can also use the effects section to add some extra flavor to your sound, such as overdrive, delay, reverb, chorus, and more.
 
One of the most distinctive features of **Toneforge Menace V1 2l** is the *Dynamic Response* control, which allows you to adjust how the amp reacts to your playing dynamics. You can dial in more compression for a tighter and more consistent sound, or less compression for a more dynamic and expressive tone. You can also use the *Bias* control to change the character of the amp from warm and smooth to cold and harsh.
 
**Toneforge Menace V1 2l** is compatible with most DAWs and supports VST, AU, AAX, and RTAS formats. It is also compatible with MIDI controllers and expression pedals for real-time control. You can use it as a standalone application or as a plugin in your DAW.
