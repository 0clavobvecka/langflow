2. Search for each downloadable image by the part number, for example: CI40XML for InfoSphere Information Server v8.7 Windows Server 32 bit Multilingual[^2^]. Download all the required images and save them in a temporary directory on your system.
3. Extract each of the images into a single directory using a file extracting utility that supports large file extractions[^2^]. You should see a setup.exe file in the extracted folder.
4. Run the setup.exe file to launch the installation wizard[^3^]. Follow the instructions on the screen to perform the basic installation of DataStage 7.5.1.
5. If you are migrating from an earlier version of DataStage, read the [migration information](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/strategicsm/10.1.3?topic=datastage-installing-infosphere) before you start the installation[^3^]. You may need to back up your existing projects and metadata before upgrading.
