If you are wondering who are The Meters and why they are so important for funk music, here is a brief introduction. The Meters were a band formed in New Orleans in the late 1960s, consisting of Art Neville on keyboards and vocals, Leo Nocentelli on guitar, George Porter Jr. on bass, and Zigaboo Modeliste on drums. They are considered to be one of the pioneers of funk music, along with James Brown and Sly and the Family Stone. They created a distinctive sound that combined elements of R&B, soul, jazz, and blues, with syncopated rhythms, tight grooves, and minimal vocals. They also influenced many other artists and genres, such as hip hop, rock, and pop.
 
Cissy Strut was released in 1969 as the first single from their debut album The Meters. It was written by all four members of the band and produced by Allen Toussaint, a famous New Orleans musician and producer. The song was named after a popular dance move at the time called the Cissy Strut, which involved moving the hips from side to side while walking. The song became a hit on the R&B charts and has been covered by many artists over the years, such as John Scofield, The Butch Cassidy Sound System, and Oz Noy. It has also been sampled by many hip hop artists, such as LL Cool J, N.W.A., and Public Enemy.
